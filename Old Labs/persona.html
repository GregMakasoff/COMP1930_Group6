	<p>Hi my name is Sasha, I'm a 21 yearold CST student at BCIT. I live in Surrey and have been commuting here since the start of school last year. My grades mean a lot to me and they have been on a asteady decline. For a while I have wondered if there was someway for me to get to school better but I am too scared to talk to anyone in my program.</p>
