	James is a 2nd year business student at BCIT. In high school, he was always around friends. When he got to BCIT, he focused heavily on his school and put his friendships on the back burner. Now that he's in his last year, he feels like he's got his academics under control and wants to make his social life a priority again. 



In his spare time, James likes playing ping pong and pool.
